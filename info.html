    <li>Principal Photography (stage in when majority of filming takes place) began on June 28, 2021. Shooting took place in France, Germany, NY City, and Japan with a $100 million budget.</li> <br>
    <li>The filming process in Paris was regarded as "hell" due to being behind thanks to a delay in Germany, additionally, Stahelski hadn't been able to scout Paris and had improved and changed filming locations last minute. </li><br>
    <li>[SPOILERS!!!] An alternative ending saw John Wick visit his grave, however this scene was scrapped due to "violent" reactions from test audiences.</li><br>
    <li>Filming concluded on October 27</li>
